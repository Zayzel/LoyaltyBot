Preparing to Setup Your Channel's Bot
-------------------------------------

####Create a new bot account

In order to use LoyaltyBot's features you will need to create a new [TwitchTV Account](http://www.twitch.tv/signup). You can name it anything
you wish, all you need to do is pass the username/password to ````bot.name```` and ````bot.password````

####Create the subscriber/loyal viewer list on Google Docs

Since TwitchTV does not have subscriber information in their api, LoyaltyBot needs a way to obtain that information.
That's where [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/) comes in.

In the following order:

- Create a new spreadsheet
- Set cell A1 as the header "Username"
- Subscriber names (must be lower case) will then be in column A starting in cell A2 and below (Fig. 1)
- Set the subscriber list to public and change the type to json (Fig. 2)

Side Notes:

- Even if you do not have a subscription button, you can still add loyal viewers to this list for the double loyalty point benefits.
- Why Google Docs and not the MySQL database? Simplicity. It's easier to manually update a google doc spreadsheet daily
then it is to update a MySQL table.

####Setting up MySQL tables

LoyaltyBot stores all of the viewer info and moderator commands in a MySQL database and requires specifc table/field names.

LoyaltyBot takes care of all table creation, however if by some chance you need to manually setup the tables the following
contains information about them:

Viewer
- Table Name: ````viewers````
- Field Names: ````user```` [primary key, not null, varchar], ````points```` [not null, integer]

Commands
- Table Name: ````commands````
- Field Names: ````id```` [primary key, autoincrement, not null, integer], ````command```` [not null, text], ````text```` [not null, longtext], ````auth```` [default: 1, integer]
